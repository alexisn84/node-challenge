  ## Description
  A Node.js application that will help you generate a professional README file. README.md files are overlooked in general due to a variety of reasons ranging from lack of knowledge of proper syntax in README.md files to laziness. This generate allows users to walk thru the steps of a proper README.md file, and based on their responses auto-generate a professinal README.md file.
